After we formed our group, we read the instructions and examples in the folder, and a few ideas we quickly brainstormed were already on the document, but that encouraged us to further explore and think of ways to expand upon these. 

## Ideas

#### Logic Gates and Colors
Since colors can be displayed in binary, we had the idea to apply logic gates to the colors by performing a logic gate on each byte. After experimenting with colors, we discovered that due to not being used to binary, even simple colors such as orange and white produced unexpeted results when logic gates were added. Hence, we think that implementing logic gates to combine multiple images would be interesting. We tried a basic implementation of an AND gate and discovered that even ANDing simple colors already results in strange unreadable results. We didn't see much of a use for this, except for one small idea. The concept of a logic gate for most people was recently introduced,
