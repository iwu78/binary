# The Internet
The internet is the network that connects all computers. This team teach will cover some basic information about the internet and how devices communicate

# IP Addresses
How devices are identified

# The OSI Model and TCP/IP Model

#### TCP/IP Protocols
A TCP/IP Protocol is a set of rules that governs something within computer communication.
The IETF, or Internet Engineering Task Force, manages these rules and facilitates the open development of them.

> Example: ASCII Protocol
 - ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a internet protocol that you may be familiar with, is a type of character encoding
 - ASCII is a protocol governing how text is represented as binary
 - 128 characters, 95 printable

There are many more protocols, each governing a specific area of how computer communicate.
Ex. ARP, DNS, FTP, UDP, PPP, SAP

We obviously can't cover every protocol, but we'll be talking about a few important ones today.

#### OSI Model
The OSI model, also known as the Open Systems Interconnection Model, helps represent communications between two computers. 

- The OSI model helps coordinate and classify standards
- Each of the many protocols can be classified into one of the seven layers
- Each layer has a function and the protocols in that layer all help with that function

| Layer | Name         | Function                                                                                | Example |
|-------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| 1     | Physical     | Transport of data between tangible, physical things                                     | DSL     |
| 2     | Data Link    | Device identification and forwarding on a LOCAL network (i.e. home, school)             | PPP     |
| 3     | Network      | Manages identification and path that a device should take, very few of these protocols  | STP     |
| 4     | Transport    | Manages transport of data between computers (delivery method, i.e. fast vs slow)        | UDP     |
| 5     | Session      | Manages connectivity between devices                                                    | SAP     |
| 6     | Presentation | Translates from data sent between computers (binary) to something humans can understand | TLS     |
| 7     | Application  | User Interaction, like resource sharing                                                 | HTTP    |

> Popcorn Hack
 - We just gave an example of a protocol, ASCII, above. What OSI Layer does ASCII fall into?
 - Give another example of a protocol from that layer

#### TCP/IP Model
 - Another method of classifying protocols
 - Simplifies OSI model into four layers
 - Application, Presentation, Session layers are summarised into one Application layer
 - Data Link and Physical layers and summarised into one Link or Physical layer
 - This layer, also known as Network Access, is focused on the transport of bits (1s and 0s) between networks

### DNS - Domain Name Service
- DNS, or Domain Name Service, is a naming system for websites on the internet.
- DNS assigns and has records that relate domain names to ip addresses

#### What is a Domain Name?
 - Domain Names are strings used to identify addresses
 - They map hard to remember IP addresses into simple string of text
 - Would you rather remember 162.159.128.233 or discord.com?
 - Each website has its own IP address that you are sent to when you visit the website
 - https://www.nslookup.io/website-to-ip-lookup/
 - nslookup (website) in command prompt

> Popcorn Hack
 - Open up a command prompt and type "nslookup google.com"
 - You should get 142.250.68.78, we mainly care about the bottom address for now
 - Try visiting that website in your search bar!

#### Subdomains
 - Subdomains are a prefix added to a domain to separate parts of the website
 - There can many subdomains, up to 127
 - We saw an example of this in our passion projects
 - (SUBDOMAIN).stu.nighthawkcodingsociety.com

#### Domain Name Service Providers
 - DNS Providers manage and sell domain names

> Popcorn Hack
 - List 4 more websites you use often and their IPs
 - What's a subdomain of your passion project backend from last time?
 - What's the domain of your current binary CPT project?
