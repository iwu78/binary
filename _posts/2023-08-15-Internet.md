## The Internet
The internet is the network that connects all computers. This team teach will cover some basic information about the internet and how devices communicate

## IP Addresses
How devices are identified

# The OSI Model and TCP/IP Model

#### TCP/IP Protocols
A TCP/IP Protocol is a set of rules that governs something within computer communication.
The IETF, or Internet Engineering Task Force, manages these rules and facilitates the open development of them.

> Example: ASCII Protocol
 - ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a internet protocol that you may be familiar with, is a type of character encoding
 - ASCII is a protocol governing how text is represented as binary
 - 128 characters, 95 printable

There are many more protocols, each governing a specific area of how computer communicate.
Ex. ARP, DNS, FTP, UDP, PPP, SAP

We obviously can't cover every protocol, but we'll be talking about a few important ones today.

#### OSI Model
The OSI model, also known as the Open Systems Interconnection Model, helps represent communications between two computers. 

- The OSI model helps coordinate and classify standards
- Each of the many protocols can be classified into one of the seven layers
- Each layer has a function and the protocols in that layer all help with that function

| Layer | Name         | Function                                                                                | Example |
|-------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| 1     | Physical     | Transport of data between tangible, physical things                                     | DSL     |
| 2     | Data Link    | Device identification and forwarding on a LOCAL network (i.e. home, school)             | PPP     |
| 3     | Network      | Manages identification and path that a device should take, very few of these protocols  | STP     |
| 4     | Transport    | Manages transport of data between computers (delivery method, i.e. fast vs slow)        | UDP     |
| 5     | Session      | Manages connectivity between devices                                                    | SAP     |
| 6     | Presentation | Translates from data sent between computers (binary) to something humans can understand | TLS     |
| 7     | Application  | User Interaction, like resource sharing                                                 | HTTP    |

> Popcorn Hack
 - We just gave an example of a protocol, ASCII, above. What OSI Layer does ASCII fall into?
 - Give another example of a protocol from that layer

#### TCP/IP Model
 - Another method of classifying protocols
 - Simplifies OSI model into four layers
 - Application, Presentation, Session layers are summarised into one Application layer
 - Data Link and Physical layers and summarised into one Link or Physical layer
 - This layer, also known as Network Access, is focused on the transport of bits (1s and 0s) between networks

# Protocols

### DNS - Domain Name Service
- DNS, or Domain Name Service, is a naming system for websites on the internet.
- DNS assigns and has records that relate domain names to ip addresses

#### What is a Domain Name?
 - Domain Names are strings used to identify addresses
 - They map hard to remember IP addresses into simple string of text
 - Would you rather remember 162.159.128.233 or discord.com?
 - Each website has its own IP address that you are sent to when you visit the website
 - https://www.nslookup.io/website-to-ip-lookup/
 - nslookup (website) in command prompt

> Popcorn Hack
 - Open up a command prompt and type "nslookup google.com"
 - You should get 142.250.68.78, we mainly care about the bottom address for now
 - Try visiting that website in your search bar!

#### Subdomains
 - Subdomains are a prefix added to a domain to separate parts of the website
 - There can many subdomains, up to 127
 - We saw an example of this in our passion projects
 - (SUBDOMAIN).stu.nighthawkcodingsociety.com

#### Domain Name Service Providers
 - DNS Providers manage and sell domain names

> Popcorn Hack
 - List 4 more websites you use often and their IPs
 - What's a subdomain of your passion project backend from last time?
 - What's the domain of your current binary CPT project?

## HTTP vs HTTPS
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are both protocols used for transferring data over the web. The key difference lies in the security aspect.

HTTP is the standard protocol for transmitting data over the internet. However, it does not provide any encryption, making it susceptible to eavesdropping and unauthorized access. This means that any information exchanged between the user's browser and the website, such as login credentials or personal data, is sent in plain text.

On the other hand, HTTPS adds a layer of security by incorporating SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) encryption. This encryption ensures that the data exchanged between the user and the website is encrypted, making it much more challenging for malicious actors to intercept or tamper with the information.

We SSL based encryption last trimester with certbot. Certbot generated SSL certificates for us to ensure HTTPS 
connection between the client and your website.

## TCP and UDP

Transmission Control Protocol

User Datagram Protocol

TCP and UDP are both Transport protocols (layer 4 of OSI and layer 3 of TCP/IP). This means they are a set of rules that specify how data is exchanged between devices over the Internet.

What's in a TCP packet?
![image](https://linuxbeans.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/2498f-tcppacketformatdiagram.gif)

The TCP handshake process - this is how a TCP session is initiated.

Step 1: Client A requests a client-to-server communication session with Server B (SYN)

![image](https://i.ibb.co/xD9sN2V/Image-11-27-23-at-8-34-PM.jpg)

Step 2: Server B acknowledges client-to-server communication session, requests server-to-client communication session (SYN-ACK)

![image](https://i.ibb.co/xgQS4wV/Image-11-27-23-at-8-34-PM-1.jpg)

Step 3: Client A acknowledges server-to-client communication session (ACK)

![image](https://i.ibb.co/gw2WB3h/Image-11-27-23-at-8-34-PM-2.jpg)

After these steps are executed in order, the communication pathway is established between Client A and Server B.

How does TCP actually send the data?

1. Client A wants to send some file to Server B. TCP will first split the data into 6 segments
2. TCP forwards the first 3 segments to the Server B
3. Server B must acknowledge that it has received the segments by sending back an ACK. If Client A doesn't receive the ACK, it resends the segments
4. Client A sends the remaining 3 segments
5. Again, Server B must send back an ACK to confirm it has received the other 3 segments

TCP Session Termination

1. Client A sends segment to server B with the FIN flag to terminate the client-to-server session
2. Server B sends ACK to client A
3. Server B sends FIN to client A to terminate the server-to-client session
4. Client A sends ACK to server B
5. The session closes

Enough about TCP... what about UDP?

UDP Pros:
- Little cost
- Faster

UDP Cons:
- Little data checking
- Generally unreliable, as no ACK messages are sent
- Packets may arrive out of order or have duplicates/missing packets

UDP sends out all packets at once without any form of handshake or acknowledgement. 

HACK:
So when do we use UDP? It seems terrible.

--- 
A:
Only for applications that can have some data loss but cannot afford to have delays.
- ex. media streaming (some lost frames ok)
- ex. games where lost data doesn't matter. for example, flappy bird.

## Homework Problems

TCP/UDP:

Research this question. 

How does TCP prevent packets from arriving out of order? (Hint: specially "out of order")

(A) Resends lost packets

(B) Assigns each segment a number

(C) Reassembles out of order packets

(D) Sends all packets to one destination address
