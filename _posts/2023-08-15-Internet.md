## The Internet
The internet is the network that connects all computers. This team teach will cover some basic information about the internet and how devices communicate

## IP Addresses
How devices are identified

## The OSI Model
Hierarchical method of representing communications between end devices.

## HTTP vs HTTPS
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are both protocols used for transferring data over the web. The key difference lies in the security aspect.

HTTP is the standard protocol for transmitting data over the internet. However, it does not provide any encryption, making it susceptible to eavesdropping and unauthorized access. This means that any information exchanged between the user's browser and the website, such as login credentials or personal data, is sent in plain text.

On the other hand, HTTPS adds a layer of security by incorporating SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) encryption. This encryption ensures that the data exchanged between the user and the website is encrypted, making it much more challenging for malicious actors to intercept or tamper with the information.

We SSL based encryption last trimester with certbot. Certbot generated SSL certificates for us to ensure HTTPS 
connection between the client and your website.

## TCP and UDP

Transmission Control Protocol

User Datagram Protocol

TCP and UDP are both Transport protocols (layer 4 of OSI and layer 3 of TCP/IP). This means they are a set of rules that specify how data is exchanged between devices over the Internet.

What's in a TCP packet?

The TCP handshake process - this is how a TCP session is initiated.

Step 1: Client A requests a client-to-server communication session with Server B (SYN)

Step 2: Server B acknowledges client-to-server communication session, requests server-to-client communication session (SYN-ACK)

Step 3: Client A acknowledges server-to-client communication session (ACK)

After these steps are executed in order, the communication pathway is established between Client A and Server B.

How does TCP actually send the data?

1. Client A wants to send some file to Server B. TCP will first split the data into 6 segments
2. TCP forwards the first 3 segments to the Server B
3. Server B must acknowledge that it has received the segments by sending back an ACK. If Client A doesn't receive the ACK, it resends the segments
4. Client A sends the remaining 3 segments
5. Again, Server B must send back an ACK to confirm it has received the other 3 segments

TCP Session Termination

1. Client A sends segment to server B with the FIN flag to terminate the client-to-server session
2. Server B sends ACK to client A
3. Server B sends FIN to client A to terminate the server-to-client session
4. Client A sends ACK to server B
5. The session closes

Enough about TCP... what about UDP?

UDP Pros:
- Little cost
- Faster

UDP Cons:
- Little data checking
- Generally unreliable, as no ACK messages are sent
- Packets may arrive out of order or have duplicates/missing packets

UDP sends out all packets at once without any form of handshake or acknowledgement. 

HACK:
So when do we use UDP? It seems terrible.

A:
Only for applications that can have some data loss but cannot afford to have delays.
- ex. media streaming (some lost frames ok)
- ex. games where lost data doesn't matter. for example, flappy bird.
