## HTTP vs HTTPS
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are both protocols used for transferring data over the web. The key difference lies in the security aspect.

HTTP is the standard protocol for transmitting data over the internet. However, it does not provide any encryption, making it susceptible to eavesdropping and unauthorized access. This means that any information exchanged between the user's browser and the website, such as login credentials or personal data, is sent in plain text.

On the other hand, HTTPS adds a layer of security by incorporating SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) encryption. This encryption ensures that the data exchanged between the user and the website is encrypted, making it much more challenging for malicious actors to intercept or tamper with the information.

We SSL based encryption last trimester with certbot. Certbot generated SSL certificates for us to
